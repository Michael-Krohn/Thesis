Previous measurements have established 65 nm CMOS as the leading candidate technology for HL-LHC electronics.
After an exposure of 200 Mrad, Bonacini, $\textit{et al.}$ reported \cite{Bonacini}, with one exception, only minor changes in transistor parameters.
The exception was a significant loss of maximum drain-source current by narrow PMOS core transistors.   They reported a 50\% reduction in maximum drive current for a 120/60 PMOS core transistor and a 35\% loss for a 360/60 PMOS core transistor.
This irradiation of ``cold'' 65 nm CMOS transistors was motivated by a concern that damage to pixel vertex detector readout electronics operated at $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ might be greater than observed in room temperature irradiations.  Our measurements show the same pattern of effects as observed previously, but the damage is less severe than was observed at room temperature, rather than more severe.
